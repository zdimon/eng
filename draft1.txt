Dr. Dave slept with one of his patients and felt guilty all day long. 

No matter how much he tried to forget about it, he couldn't. 

The guilt and sense of betrayal was overwhelming. 

But every once in a while, he'd hear an internal voice that said, "Dave, don't worry about it. 

You aren't the first doctor to sleep with one of their patients, and you won't be the last. 

And you're single. Let it go."

But invariably, the other voice would bring him back to reality.

"But Dave, you're a vet."

An old man enters a confessional and proudly exclaims, 
"Father, I have to tell you what happened to me last night. 

I'm 90 years old, and I made love to two 18-year-old women for eight hours!"
The stern priest replies, "That is a sin. 
I will have to give you a penance."

"Father, you can't give me a penance."

"Why not?"

"Because I'm Jewish."

The perplexed Father asks, "Then why are you telling me?"

"I'm telling everyone!"
