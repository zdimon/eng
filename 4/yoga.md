For thousands of years such phenomena have been studied, investigated, and 
generalised, the whole ground of the religious faculties of man has been 
analysed, and the practical result is the science of Raja-Yoga. Raja-Yoga 
does not, after the unpardonable manner of some modern scientists, deny the 
existence of facts which are difficult to explain; on the other hand, it gently 
yet in no uncertain terms tells the superstitious that miracles, and answers to 
prayers, and powers of faith, though true as facts, are not rendered 
comprehensible through the superstitious explanation of attributing them to 
the agency of a being, or beings, above the clouds. It declares that each man 
is only a conduit for the infinite ocean of knowledge and power that lies 
behind mankind. It teaches that desires and wants are in man, that the power 
of supply is also in man; and that wherever and whenever a desire, a want, a 
prayer has been fulfilled, it was out of this infinite magazine that the supply 
came, and not from any supernatural being. The idea of supernatural beings may rouse to a certain extent the power of action in man, but it also brings 
spiritual decay.
