##Raja Yoga

###In the first place, if you analyse all the various religions of the world, you will find that these are divided into two classes, those with a book and those without a book. 

###Those with a book are the strongest, and have the largest number of followers. Those without books have mostly died out, and the few new ones have very small followings. 


####follower /ˈfɑːloʊər/

- a person who supports and admires a particular person or set of ideas
    *the followers of Mahatma Gandhi*
- a person who is very interested in a particular activity and follows all the recent news about it
    *keen followers of football*
    *a follower of fashion*
- a person who does things after somebody else has done them first
    *She is a leader, not a follower.*
- a person who chooses to regularly receive somebody’s messages using a microblogging service
    *a celebrity with thousands of followers on Twitter*


Yet, in all of them we find one 
consensus of opinion, that the truths they teach are the results of the 
experiences of particular persons. The Christian asks you to believe in his 
religion, to believe in Christ and to believe  in him as the incarnation of God, 
to believe in a God, in a soul, and in a better state of that soul. If I ask him 
for reason, he says he believes in them. But if you go to the fountain - head 
of Christianity, you will find that it is based upon experience. Christ said he 
saw God; the disciples said they felt God; and so forth. Similarly, in 
Buddhism, it is Buddha's experience. He experienced certain truths, saw 
them, came in contact with them, and preached them to the world. So with 
the Hindus. In their books the writers, who are called Rishis, or sages, 
declare they experienced certain truths, and these they preach. Thus it is 
clear that all the religions of the world have been built upon that one 
universal and adamantine foundation of all our knowledge -- direct 
experience. The teachers all saw God; they all saw their own souls, they saw 
their future, they saw their eternity, and what they saw they preached. Only 
there is this difference that by most of these religions especially in modern 
times, a peculiar claim is made, namely, that these experiences are 
impossible at the present day; they were only possible with a few men, who 
were the first founders of the religions that subsequently bore their names. 
At the present time these experiences have become obsolete, and, therefore, 
we have now to take religion on belief. This I entirely deny. If there has been 
one experience in this world in any particular branch of knowledge, it 
absolutely follows that that experience has been possible millions of times 
before, and will be repeated eternally. Uniformity is the rigorous law of 
nature; what once happened can happen always.

The teachers of the science of Yoga, therefore, declare that religion is not 
only based upon the experience of ancient times, but that no man can be 
religious until he has the same perceptions himself. Yoga is the science 
which teaches us how to get these perceptions. It is not much use to talk 
about religion until one has felt it. Why is there so much disturbance, so 
much fighting and quarrelling in the name of God? There has been more 
bloodshed in the name of God than for any other cause, because people

never went to the fountain - head; they were content only to give a mental 
assent to the customs of their forefathers, and wanted others to do the same.
