####Dr. Dave slept with one of his patients and felt guilty all day long. 

####No matter how much he tried to forget about it, he couldn't. 

####The guilt and sense of betrayal was overwhelming. 

####But every once in a while, he'd hear an internal voice that said, "Dave, don't worry about it. 

####You aren't the first doctor to sleep with one of their patients, and you won't be the last. 

####And you're single. Let it go."

####But invariably, the other voice would bring him back to reality.

####"But Dave, you're a vet."
