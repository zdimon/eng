_Since the dawn of history, various extraordinary phenomena have been 
recorded as happening amongst human beings. Witnesses are not wanting in 
modern times to attest to the fact of such events, even in societies living 
under the full blaze of modern science. The vast mass of such evidence is 
unreliable, as coming from ignorant, superstitious, or fraudulent persons. In 
many instances the so - called miracles are imitations. But what do they 
imitate? It is not the sign  of a candid and scientific mind to throw overboard 
anything without proper investigation. Surface scientists, unable to explain 
the various extraordinary mental phenomena, strive to ignore their very 
existence. They are, therefore, more culpable than those who think that their 
prayers are answered by a being, or beings, above the clouds, or than those 
who believe that their petitions will make such beings change the course of 
the universe. The latter have the excuse of ignorance, or at least of a 
defective system of education, which has taught them dependence upon such 
beings, a dependence which has become a part of their degenerate nature. 
The former have no such excuse._

Уже на заре истории человек начал отмечать различные необычные явления. В наше время тоже нет недостатка в свидетелях, готовых подтвердить их существование, даже в странах, где расцветает современная наука. Большая часть таких свидетельств недостоверна, поскольку исходит от людей невежественных, суеверных или попросту лживых. Во многих случаях так называемые чудеса — это подделки. Но подделки подо что? Честный научный разум не может отвергнуть факты, не разобравшись в них. Поверхностные ученые, сталкиваясь с необычными ментальными явлениями, которые они не в силах объяснить, стараются закрыть на них глаза. Они заслуживают даже большего осуждения, чем те, кто думают, будто их молитвы находят отклик у некоего существа или существ, находящихся над облаками, и рассчитывают, что их мольбы заставят эти существа изменить ход вселенной. Взгляды этих людей можно оправдать их невежеством или характером образования, которое они получили и которое привело их к зависимости от таких существ, ставшей со временем частью их ослабленной натуры. А у ученого таких оправданий нет.
