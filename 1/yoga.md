##Raja Yoga

##Each soul is potentially divine.

##The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal.

##Do this either by work, or worship, or psychic control, or philosophy -- by one, or more, or all of these -- and be free.


####divine /dɪˈvaɪn/ - coming from or connected with God or a god, wonderful; beautiful


###All our knowledge is based upon experience. What we call inferential knowledge, in which we go from the less to the more general, or from the general to the particular, has experience as its basis. 

####inferential - выведенный

###In what are called the exact sciences, people easily find the truth, because it appeals to the particular experiences of every human being. 

####In what are called - в так называемых

###The scientist does not tell you to believe in anything, but he has certain results which come from his own experiences, and reasoning on them when he asks us to believe in his conclusions, he appeals to some universal experience of humanity. 

####reasoning /ˈriːzənɪŋ/ - the process of thinking about things in a logical way 
    (рассуждения)

###In every exact science there is a basis which is common to all humanity, so that we can at once see the truth or the fallacy of the conclusions drawn therefrom. 

####fallacy /ˈfæləsi/ - a false idea that many people believe is true

###Now, the question is: Has religion any such basis or not? I shall have to answer the question both in the affirmative and in the negative.

####affirmative /əˈfɜːrmətɪv/ - means ‘yes’ or expresses agreement

###Religion, as it is generally taught all over the world, is said to be based upon faith and belief, and, in most cases, consists only of different sets of theories, and that is the reason why we find all religions quarrelling with one another. 

####quarrel BrE /ˈkwɒrəl/ ; NAmE  /ˈkwɑːrəl/  - an angry argument or disagreement between people


###These theories, again, are based upon belief. One man says there is a great Being sitting above the clouds and governing the whole universe, and he asks me to believe that solely on the authority of his assertion. 

####solely /ˈsoʊlli/  = only


####assertion /əˈsɜːrʃn/ 

- a statement saying that you strongly believe something to be true
- claiming something strongly

####govern BrE /ˈɡʌvn/ ; NAmE /ˈɡʌvərn/ 

- to legally control a country or its people, somebody/something
- if a word governs another word or phrase, it affects how that word or phrase is formed or used


####In the same way, I may have my own ideas, which I am asking others to believe, and if they ask a reason, I cannot give them any. This is why religion and metaphysical philosophy have a bad name nowadays. Every educated man seems to say, "Oh, these religions are only bundles of theories without any standard to judge them by, each man preaching his own pet ideas." 


####bundle /ˈbʌndl/ 

    - a number of things tied or wrapped together
    - a number of things that belong, or are sold together
    a bundle of laughs - a person or thing that makes you laugh
    a bundle [singular] (informal) a large amount of money

Idioms

    bundle of nerves - be very nervous
    drop your bundle -  to act in a stupid way because you have lost control over yourself


#### preach verb /priːtʃ

    - to give a religious talk in a public place
    - to give somebody advice on moral standards, behaviour, etc., especially in a way that they find annoying or boring "You're preaching at me again!"


Idioms

    practise what you preach
    preach to the converted

###Nevertheless, there is a basis of universal belief in religion, governing all the different theories and all the varying ideas of different sects in different countries. Going to their basis we find that they also are based upon universal experiences.
